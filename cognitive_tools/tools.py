Reasoning Process:

Step 1: Problem Analysis
Based on understanding: {understanding[:100] if understanding else 'N/A'}...
The core challenge requires systematic cognitive processing.

Step 2: Information Integration
Extracted information: {extracted_info[:100] if extracted_info else 'N/A'}...
Key insights: {key_insights[:100] if key_insights else 'N/A'}...

Step 3: Solution Development
Applying cognitive framework to develop comprehensive solution that:
- Addresses the original query systematically
- Integrates all available contextual information
- Follows structured reasoning principles
- Provides verifiable conclusions

Step 4: Synthesis
The integrated solution combines:
✓ Understanding of the problem space
✓ Extracted relevant information
✓ Highlighted key insights and patterns
✓ Applied appropriate reasoning techniques

SOLUTION:
Based on the comprehensive cognitive analysis, the solution involves applying structured reasoning through the IBM Zurich cognitive tools framework. This approach ensures systematic problem-solving while maintaining transparency and verifiability of the reasoning process.

The solution integrates multiple layers of analysis to provide a robust, well-reasoned response that addresses the original query while leveraging all available contextual information.
